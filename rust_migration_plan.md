# Rust Migration Plan

## Current Status
The initial Rust rewrite attempt revealed several architectural challenges:
1. Complex API client initialization
2. Type system inconsistencies
3. Error handling unification
4. Configuration management

## Phase 1: Preparation (1 week)
- [ ] Freeze JavaScript feature set
- [ ] Create detailed component diagram
- [ ] Define clear interface contracts
- [ ] Establish error handling strategy

## Phase 2: Component Migration (2 weeks)
1. Metadata Providers
   - [ ] Simkl client
   - [ ] TMDB client
   - [ ] TVDB client
2. Processing Core
   - [ ] History processor
   - [ ] CSV generator
3. Scraping Engine
   - [ ] Browser automation
   - [ ] Data extraction

## Phase 3: Integration (1 week)
- [ ] CLI interface
- [ ] Configuration loader
- [ ] Logging system
- [ ] Progress tracking

## Phase 4: Testing & Validation (1 week)
- [ ] Unit tests (80% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests
- [ ] End-to-end test with Prime Video
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## Risks & Mitigation
| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| API changes | Medium | High | Abstract client interfaces |
| Browser automation failures | High | Critical | Multiple fallback strategies |
| Metadata lookup errors | High | Medium | Multi-source validation |

## Resource Requirements
- Developer: 2 weeks dedicated effort
- QA Engineer: 3 days for testing
- Project Manager: Ongoing oversight

Total estimated timeline: 5 weeks
